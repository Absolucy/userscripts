# Aspen's userscripts

 - [Aternos Anti-Anti-Adblock](https://github.com/aspenluxxxy/scripts/raw/dev/scripts/AternosAntiAntiAdblock.user.js) - Get rid of Aternos' annoying full-page anti-adblock banner.
 - [GTFOTrending](https://github.com/aspenluxxxy/scripts/raw/dev/scripts/GTFOTrending.user.js) - Filters out things related to Minecraft youtubers (especially Dream SMP) from the twitter.com trending sidebar.

## How to use

Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) for your browser, and download/open the raw script. The extension should prompt for you to install it.

Any issues related to non-Violentmonkey userscript plugins, such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, will be ignored unless they can be replicated on Violentmonkey.

### Why not Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey?

 - Tampermonkey is proprietary software. It was open source on versions 2.9 and earlier, but it is not any more.
 - Greasemonkey is simply less capable than Tamper/Violentmonkey, last I checked.

## Licensing

All userscripts are licensed under a modified [BSD-3-Clause](LICENSE.md) license unless otherwise specified.
